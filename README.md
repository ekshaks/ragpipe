## Introduction

Ragpipe helps you extract insights from large document repositories *quickly*. 

Ragpipe is lean and nimble. Makes it easy to iterate fast, tweak components of your RAG pipeline until you get desired responses.

Yet another RAG framework? Although popular RAG frameworks make it easy to setup RAG pipelines, they lack primitives that enable you to iterate and get to desired responses quickly. 

Watch a quick [video intro](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLPfjV1xMkS1k9J7q2v3eQ2U-At6p3evM).

**Updates**

* 21.11.24. Added [SEC10k example](examples/sec10k/) - query any PDF using Colpali, Docling, VLMs.
* 25.10.24. Support for blazing fast [Model2Vec plugin](ext/libs/model2vec.py).
* 3.9.24. Quickstart *FounderMode* notebook [cookbook](examples/quickstart/pg.ipynb).

---

Instead of the usual `chunk-embed-match-rank` flow, Ragpipe adopts a holistic, end-to-end view of the pipeline:

- build a hierarchical **document model**, 
- **decompose** a complex query into sub-queries 
- **resolve** sub-queries and obtain responses
- **aggregate** the query responses.

How do we resolve each sub-query?
- choose **representations** for document parts relevant to a sub-query, 
- specify the **bridges** among those representations, 
- **merge** the retrieved docs across bridges to setup a context,
- present the query and context to a language model to compute the final response

The `represent-bridge-merge` pattern is very powerful and allows us to build and iterate over all kinds of complex retrieval pipelines, including those based on the traditional `retrieve-rank-rerank` pattern and more recent advanced RAG patterns. Evals can be attached to `bridge` or `merge` nodes to verify intermediate results. See examples below.

*Note: Under active development. Expect breaking changes.*


## Installation

Using `pip`.
```bash
pip install ragpipe
```


Alternatively, clone the repository and use `pip` to install dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekshaks/ragpipe; cd ragpipe
#creating a new environment with python 3.10
conda create -n ragpipe python=3.10
#activating the environment
conda activate ragpipe
#install ragpipe dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: For CUDA support on Windows/Linux you might need to install PyTorch with CUDA compiled.
For instructions follow https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

## Key Ideas

**Representations**. Choose the query/document fields as well as how to represent each chosen query / document field to aid similarity/relevance computation (*bridges*) over the entire document repository. Representations can be text strings, dense/sparse vector embeddings or arbitrary data objects, and help *bridge* the gap between the query and the documents.

**Bridges**. Choose a *pair* of query and document representation to *bridge*. A bridge serves as a relevance indicator: one of the several criteria for identifying the relevant documents for a query. In practice, several bridges together determine the degree to which a document is relevant to a query. A bridge is a ranker and top-k selector, rolled into one. Computing each bridge creates a unique ranked list of documents with respect to the relevance criteria.

**Merges**. Specify how to combine the bridges in sequential or parallel pipelines, e.g., combine ranked list of documents, retrieved via multiple bridges, into a single ranked list using rank fusion.

**Data Model**. A hierarchical data structure that consists of all the (nested) documents. The data model is created from the original document files and is retained over the entire pipeline. We compute representations for arbitrary nested fields of the data, without flattening the data tree.


## Querying with Ragpipe

To query over a data repository, 

1. Build a hierachical data model over your data repositories, e.g., `{"documents" : [{"text": ...}, ...]}`. 

2. In the `project.yml` config file:

- Specify which document fields will be represented and how.
- Specify which representations to compute for the query.
- Specify `bridges`: which pair of query and doc field representation should be matched to find relevant documents.
- Specify `merges`: how to combine multiple bridges, sequentially or in parallel, to yield the final ranked list of relevant documents.

3. Specify how to generate response to the query using the above ranked document list and a large language model.
4. Iterate by making quick changes to (1), (2) or (3).

## Quick Start

**Ragpipe CLI**. *(coming soon)*

**Configure and Run Pipeline**. Configure the query pipeline by building the data model, specifying representations/encoders for document fields and bridges for matching and ranking.

- Create two files `project.yml` (config file) and `project.py` (build data model) for your project.
- Run `python project.py`
- Quickstart templates are available here: [examples/quickstart/project.yml](project.yml), [examples/quickstart/project.py](project.py). Copy and modify as per your RAG pipeline and project structure.
 

The default LLM is [Groq](https://groq.com/). Please set GROQ_API_KEY in `.env`. Alternatively, openai LLMs (set `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and ollama based local LLMs (`ollama/..` or `local/..`) are also supported.

## Examples

A notebook explaining how to setup a simple **end-to-end RAG pipeline** with `ragpipe` is [here](examples/quickstart/pg.ipynb).

Several examples are in the [examples](examples) directory.

For instance, run [`examples/insurance`](examples/insurance).
```
examples/insurance/
|
|-- insurance.py
|-- insurance.yml
```

```bash 
python -m examples.insurance.insurance
```


## API Usage

Embed ragpipe into your Agents by delegating fine-grained retrieval to ragpipe.

```python

def rag():
    from ragpipe.config import load_config
    config = load_config('examples/<project>/config.yml', show=True) #see examples/*/*.yml

    query_text = config.queries[0] #user-provided query
    D = build_data_model(config) # D.docs.<> contain documents

    from ragpipe import Retriever
    docs_retrieved = Retriever(config).eval(query_text, D)
    for doc in docs_retrieved: doc.show()

    from ragpipe.llms import respond_to_contextual_query as respond
    result = respond(query_text, docs_retrieved, config.prompts['qa'], config.llm_models['default']) 
    
    print(f'\nQuery: {query_text}')
    print('\nGenerated answer: ', result)
```

## Tests

```bash
pytest examples/test_all.py
```


## Key Dependencies

Ragpipe relies on 
- `rank_bm25`: for BM25 based retrieval
- `fastembed`, `sentence-transformers`: dense and sparse embeddings
- `chromadb`, `qdrant-client`: vector databases (add more as plugins)
- `litellm`: interact with LLM APIs
- `jinja2`: prompt formatting
- `pdf2image`, `docling`: parsing PDFs, images

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors related to protocol buffers, use the following fix: `export PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python`
